    "#### Attempt 1\n",
    "It was helpful to think of the prices as elevation, with the array as a linear trail consisting of a series of peaks and valleys. I am a climber who would like to know the greatest increase in elevation while traveling one direction along the array. I can teleport, but I don't know the elevation at a given point until I travel to that location. I am given two flags labeled `lo` and `hi`.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I begin by travelling downhill until I reach a valley as a starting point. If I reach the end of the trail without finding a valley, it means I never increased elevation and should return `0`. After placing `lo` at my starting point, I travel along the entire trail to find the highest peak and place `hi` at this location. I then move `lo` forward to the lowest valley before `hi` and record the elevation gain from `lo` to `hi` in my notebook. From this point, there could be a larger elevation change after `hi`, but not before it. I pick up my flags and repeat my steps on the remaining section of the trail, marking down the new elevation change. I will eventually reach the end of the trail, at which point I return the greatest elevation change I recorded in my notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a trail with $n$ points. The fastest time is if there is no elevation gain, in which case it takes $n-1$ steps to reach the end of the trail. If the highest peak is at the very end of the trail, the slowest time will be if the lowest valley is just before the highest peak at $n-2$. It will take $n-1$ steps to find the peak and $n-2$ steps to find the trail, or $2n-3$ steps in total. The worst case time will be $\\sum_{i=1}^{m}(2l_i - 3)$, where $m$ is the number of segments and $l_i$ is the length of the $i^{th}$ segment. Thus, the time complexity is $O(n)$."
